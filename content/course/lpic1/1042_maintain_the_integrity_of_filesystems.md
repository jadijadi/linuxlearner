# 104.2 Maintain the integrity of filesystems
*Weight: 2*

Candidates should be able to maintain a standard filesystem, as well as the extra data associated with a journaling filesystem.

# Objectives

- Verify the integrity of filesystems.
- Monitor free space and inodes.
- Repair simple filesystem problems.


- du
- df
- fsck
- e2fsck
- mke2fs
- debugfs
- dumpe2fs
- tune2fs
- xfs tools

# fsck
If anything bad happens for your filesystem (say power suddenly goes down) you will have a corrupted file system. The command to fix this is `fsck`. Technically this command is a front end for many commands:

````
jadi@funlife:~$ ls /sbin/*fsck*
/sbin/dosfsck	   /sbin/fsck.ext2     /sbin/fsck.fat	 /sbin/fsck.vfat
/sbin/e2fsck	   /sbin/fsck.ext3     /sbin/fsck.minix
/sbin/fsck	   /sbin/fsck.ext4     /sbin/fsck.msdos
/sbin/fsck.cramfs  /sbin/fsck.ext4dev  /sbin/fsck.nfs
````

> Some of these are just hardlinks to `e2fsck` command

A common switch during boot is `-A` which tells fsck to check all file systems in /etc/fstab ordered by *passno* in that file which is 6th field (File systems with *passno* of 0, wont be checked during the boot.

````
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
/dev/sdb is in use.
e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.


root@funlife:~# umount /dev/sdb
umount: /dev/sdb: not mounted
root@funlife:~# umount /dev/sdb1
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
ext2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block
fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 or
    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>
````

You can also check filesystems with UUID (find them with `blkid` command or with labels):

````
root@funlife:~# fsck /dev/sdb
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
e2fsck 1.42.10 (18-May-2014)
ext2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block
fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdb

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 or
    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>

root@funlife:~# blkid
/dev/sda1: LABEL="movies"
/dev/sdb1: UUID="BA82-BECD" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="381add66-01"
root@funlife:~# fsck LABEL=movies
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
root@funlife:~# fsck UUID="BA82-BECD"
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
fsck.fat 3.0.26 (2014-03-07)
/dev/sdb1: 14 files, 1972/945094 clusters
````

You can use `-N` switch to see what command/test is going to be executed:

````
root@funlife:~# fsck -N UUID="BA82-BECD"
fsck from util-linux 2.25.1
[/sbin/fsck.vfat (1) -- /dev/sdb1] fsck.vfat /dev/sdb1
````

> If you want to check a XFS filesystem, you have to use `xfs_check` command

### tune2fs
This is a command to tune *ext* file systems. It can show information and set many options. The `-l` option lists the current configs:

````

### xfs_info
This is same as the `tune2fs` but for xfs file systems.

> xfs_info should be used on mounted file systems

# du & df

In many cases you want to find out about the free space of a disk or find how much space a directory is using. This space can be used by the blocks of files or inodes.

> inodes contain the information about files. Information like the owner, when the last time it is used or edited, its size, if its a directory or not and peoples access rights on if. The inode number is unique within a particular filesystem and is also called files serial number.

## df
The DiskFree command is used to find out about the free and used space of file systems.

````
jadi@funlife:~$ df -TH
Filesystem        Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2         ext4       23G   15G  7.7G  65% /
none              tmpfs     4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
udev              devtmpfs  3.9G  4.0K  3.9G   1% /dev
tmpfs             tmpfs     788M  1.4M  786M   1% /run
none              tmpfs     5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock
none              tmpfs     3.9G   19M  3.9G   1% /run/shm
none              tmpfs     100M   28K  100M   1% /run/user
/dev/mapper/chome ext4      243G  229G   14G  95% /home/jadi
/dev/sdb1         vfat      3.7G  7.8M  3.6G   1% /media/jadi/BA82-BECD
````

Here, the `-T` switch make df to show the file system types and `-H` make numbers human readable (in powers of 1000). Please note that `-h` is also human readable but in powres of 1024 (e.g. shows 1k for 1000 bytes.

If you need the inode data, use the `-i` switch:

````
jadi@funlife:~$ df -i
Filesystem          Inodes  IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/sda2          1531904 458616  1073288   30% /

````

> vfat file format has no inodes; there is no owner or access rights on vfat filesystems.

## du
The DiskUsage command give information about the used space of **directories and files**. The common switches are:

|switch|usage|
|---|---|
|-h|print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)|
|-H|print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)|
|-c|show the grand total|
|--max-depth 2|shows only 2 directories furthur|
|-s|Only shows the summary and not all the directories one by one|

# Repairing
We used the `fcsk` for showing file system information but it is designed to *fix* file systems too. If the boot time check find a problems, you will be put into a command line to fix the problems.

On non-journaling file systems (ext2) the fsck will show you many questions about each block and you have to say `y` if you want it to fix them. On journaling file systems (ext3&4, xfs, ..) the fsck has much less tasks to perform.

> for xfs file systems, we have `xfs_check` command

An important switch is `-n` which causes these commands **not to fix** anything and just show what was going to be done.

## debugfs
This is an interactive tool for debug an ext filesystem. It opens the filesystem in read-only mode unless we tell it not to (with `-w` option). It can un-delete files and directories..

# Superblock
Unix systems use superblocks to save *filesystem metadata*. Most of the times this block is located at the beginning of the file system and replicated on other locations too. The `-n` of `mke2fs` displays superblock locations
